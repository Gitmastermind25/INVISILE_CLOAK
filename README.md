This project implements a real-time invisible cloak effect using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. The idea is to make any red-colored object (like a red cloak or t-shirt) appear invisible by replacing it with the background captured earlier. It works by detecting red color in the video frame using HSV color space masking and replacing those areas with pixels from a static background image. The result is a visual illusion that hides the red object in real time. To run the project, first execute background.py to capture the background without any person in the frame. Then run invisible_cloak.py while wearing a red cloth to see the cloak effect. Make sure to run this in good lighting and avoid red elements in the background. This project is a fun way to explore basic computer vision concepts like color detection, image masking, and bitwise operations.
